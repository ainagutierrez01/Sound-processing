E2: Generating a complex and a simple sinusoid, implementation of DFT and IDFT and computation of magintude spectrum.

E3: Minimize energy spread in DFT of sinusoids, symmetry properties of the DFT, suppressing frequency components using DFT model, and FFT size and zero-padding.

E4: Extracting the main lobe of the spectrum of a window, measuring noise in the reconstructed signal using the STFT model, computing band-wise energy envelopes of a signal and computing an onset detection function.
